To start first u need to write
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
after you will have a local host http://0.0.0.0:8077 
but you need to use http://0.0.0.0 because of nginx

```bash
http://0.0.0.0/app/stats/ -> to see statistics
http://0.0.0.0/app/transactions/ -> to create transactions
```
